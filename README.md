# Custcene Maker
Tool that helps you making cutscene for Super Mario Galaxy 2.
README in progress. If you can't run the app install .NET 9 but I think actually it's not mandatory.

## To do:

- ~~Add resizable timeline~~ *Done*
- ~~Fix the SubPart box in timeline to make it match the part line~~ *Done*
- ~~Add support for exporting with Yaz0~~ *Done*
- ~~Add that when you click on `Save As` the name of the file appears instead of `DemoMyCutscene.arc`~~ *Done*
- ~~Add support for creating arcs~~ *Done*
- ~~Add the ability to move parts before or after other parts in the timeline~~ *Done*
- ~~Add zoom functionality in the timeline~~ *Done*
- ~~Add optimization to the timeline~~ *Done*
- ~~Add an empty cutscene screen (cutscene without part saying how to create a new part)~~ *Done*
- ~~Add a proper "button" to the cutscenes in the cutscene sidebar~~ *Done*
- ~~Add some context menus because people like them~~ *Done*
- ~~Add ComboBox for CastName, ActionType and other things~~ *I (Antonio225) believe that it's done.*
- ~~Add a better warning for unsaved progress~~ *Done but a bit bugged*
- ~~Add some cool icons (if I can do them cool lel)~~ *Done*
- Add icons to the timeline part
- Add storage and a settings menu

### Auto completion support:

* From **Action:** `CastName` (**yes**), `ActionType` (**yes**), `PosName` (**yes**), `AnimName` (**yes**[^1]);
* From **Player:** `PosName` (**yes**) `BckName` (**yes**);
* From **Camera:** `CameraTargetName` (**yes**), `AnimCameraName` (**yes**[^1]);
* From **Sound:** `Bgm` (**yes**), `SystemSe` (**yes**), `ActionSe` (**yes**);
* From **Wipe:** `WipeName` (**yes**), `WipeType` (**yes**);

[^1]: Antonio225 still didn't understand how to convert ObjNameTable english entries to link to **.arc**s filenames so... Support for it might not work properly.
