# Custcene Maker
README in progress. If you can't run the app install .NET 9 but I think actually it's not mandatory.

To do:

- Add RARC support.
- Add some picker lists for Wipe and Action.
- Fix some little bugs.
- ~~Add a timeline control~~

## Building
To build use Hack.io and Hack.io.BCSV.

## Credits
- Hack.io libraries: Super Hackio
- MessageBox.Avalonia: CreateLab
