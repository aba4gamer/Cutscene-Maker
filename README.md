# Custcene Maker
README in progress. If you can't run the app install .NET 9 but I think actually it's not mandatory.

To do:

- ~~Update the README.md~~ *Done*
- ~~Fix the warning spam when building~~ *Done*
- ~~"Fix" the menu buttons to make them work~~ *Done*
- ~~Move the RARC handlers in Abacus~~ *Done*
- Fix the SubPart box in timeline to make it match the part line
- Add some cool icons (if I can do them cool lel)
- Add some context menus because people like them
- Add support for creating arcs
- Add support for exporting with Yaz0
- Add ComboBox for CastName, ActionType and other things
- Add zoom functionality in the timeline
- Add icons to the timeline part
- Add the ability to move parts before or after other parts in the timeline
- Add that when you click on `Save As` the name of the file appears instead of `DemoMyCutscene.arc`
- Add a proper "button" to the cutscenes in the cutscene sidebar
- Add a better warning for unsaved progress
- Add an empty cutscene screen (cutscene without part saying how to create a new part)
